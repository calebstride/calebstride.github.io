## Creation
### Why?
I've always liked to keep on top of my personal finances. Although finding an easy way 
to do so was a struggle. For a couple of years I used spreadsheets to keep track of all my 
spending. This was pretty messy and only held basic information for transactions 
(such as how much and the day). So I decided to put my free time to good use and create an 
application to store and manage this data instead.

### How?
When I started designing and coding the first website I didn't really have that much web 
experience and was fresh out of university. So I decided to use what I php which was what
I had most experience with in web design. [You can read about the 
first design](manageCabbage/previousDesign.html).

After a while the website seemed like it was in need of an upgrade. It didn't help 
that the whole of the backend was written in php (a language I knew little about). 
So I decided to start looking at more up-to-date technologies and how I could better 
utilise my Java experience. You can 
[read about the design](manageCabbage/design.html) 
and the further stages in this section.

## FAQs

### Can I use it?
Unfortunately the website is not being hosted currently. It also probably doesn't meet the
specific standards for storing user financial data. However, you can use the
[android mobile application version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.managecabbage.android).
which runs locally on your mobile device.

### Why don't you just use one of the many existing applications?
I know there are currently a lot of different mobile apps and web applications for
managing personal finances. I always had issues with these though, as they didn't quite 
meet the requirements I needed for them. By making my own, I can easily add features
and meet all the requirements I need.

### Will you integrate your app to pick up external transactions (e.g. through bank apis)?
It's been something I've thought about. It would definitely reduce the manual effort of
entering each transaction. The easiest way would be to use the open banking api but again,
this would require certain licenses and additional costs. 

### Where did the name come from?
I was trying to think of a name for the website when buying a domain to host it. 
One of my friends suggested this and it just kind of stuck.
