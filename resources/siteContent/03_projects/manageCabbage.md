Manage Cabbage is a personal spending management web application created by me. It's main purpose is to record spending 
and to give insights into how money has been spent.

## Creation
### Why?
I've always liked to keep on top of my personal finances. Although finding an easy way 
to do so was a struggle. For a couple of years I used spreadsheets to keep track of all my 
spending. This was pretty messy and only held basic information for transactions 
(such as how much and the day). So I decided to put my free time to good use and create a website
to store and manage this data instead.

### How?
When I started designing and coding the website I didn't really have that much web 
experience and was fresh out of university. So I decided to use what I php which was what
I had most experience with in web design. You can read about the first design 
[here](manageCabbage/manageCabbageOld.html).

After a while the website seemed like it was in need of an upgrade. It didn't help 
that the whole of the backend was written in php (a language I knew little about). 
So I decided to start looking at more up-to-date technologies and how I could better 
utilise my Java experience.


## FAQs

### Can I use it?
Unfortunately, not currently. Maybe in the future I'll make it publicly accessible but at 
the moment I wouldn't be comfortable for other people to use it, and it probably doesn't
meet the specific standards for storing financial data.

### Why don't you just use one of the many existing applications?
I know there are currently a lot of different mobile apps and web applications for
managing personal finances. I always had issues with these though, as they didn't quite 
meet the requirements I needed for them. By making my own, I can easily add features
and meet all the requirements I need.

### Will you integrate your website to pick up external transactions (e.g. through bank apis)?
It's been something I've thought about. It would definitely reduce the manual effort of
entering each transaction. The easiest way would be to use the open banking api but again,
this would require certain licenses and additional costs. 

### Where did the name come from?
I was trying to think of a name for the website when buying a domain to host it. 
One of my friends suggested this and it just kind of stuck.
