This page is about the initial version of "Manage Cabbage". It follows the processes 
and designing I went through from start to finish. Whilst hopefully picking out some 
interesting things I learnt along the way. Admittedly I am writing this a long time 
after creating the website, so it will be on the briefer side.

## Introduction
The main goals of the web app were to allow for spending to be logged and to show 
insights of the spending to the user.

To start, I briefly designed how the website would function and the technologies 
needed to do so. Then I went on to design how the code would work and the objects 
etc. needed to run it.

## Technologies
### Backend
At the time of starting this project the only programming language I knew how to 
use as a website backend was php so that's what I went with.

I did a bit of googling for a php hosting platform (there are tonnes apparently) 
and ended up going with hostgator as it was reasonably low cost and provided what 
I needed. Although I wouldn't choose this again as it was hosted in America (whoops).

The choice of the hosting platform meant I was stuck with mysql as a database. 
But luckily it was the one I'd worked with before when using php.

### Frontend
There isn't really much of a choice for frontend technologies for a website as 
it's mainly just HTML and JavaScript. 

I decided to not use any of the big JavaScript libraries 
(e.g. JQuery or Prototype) or different flavours of JavaScript 
(e.g. CoffeeScript, TypeScript). The reason being I wanted to try and 
learn the fundamentals and how it worked rather than just learning a specific 
way to use it. My final thought on this can be found [here](#javascript).

## Designing and Implementing
Honestly there wasn't too much designing that took place for this project. 
The simple outline would be that the user could add transactions that would 
CREDIT or DEBIT against accounts. I also added categories, so you could group 
transactions together and sum their values.

I drew up some entity relation diagrams to get an idea of the objects I would
need to create and persist in the database.

I then just went through these and created simple web pages to apply CRUD 
operations to each entity. In the code I just used plain sql that would insert 
the values provided from the UI (whilst validating the values and parsing them correctly
and safely).

## Testing
Admittedly this is an area that I could have improved a lot on. 
I didn't look into any testing frameworks for php so my the code for
this has absolutely no tests :(. The same goes with the JavaScript in the project.

Instead, I just did manual testing. Luckily the system isn't that big, and 
I was only adding small features so the manual testing didn't take very long.

## Key Points Learned
### Size of Application
Something I didn't really think about was how big this application would be. 
I know that it was relatively simple but currently the whole database is only 
82KB, and that's after about three years of use. Admittedly that's with only one 
user. But even with 1000 users that would still only be 82MB, and with 1,000,000 
about 82GB. This is just something that stood out, as it helps you realise how 
little storage simple numeric/text based data can use up.

### Testing
I think even though this was a smaller project I should have added tests. This 
would have allowed me to find some issues earlier, before I deployed the changes. 
As well as picking up some smaller issues that passed through the gaps in my testing. 
The downside to this would be that I'd probably have spent more time writing tests 
than the actual website.

### Code Design
In addition to testing, this is an area I should have paid more attention to. 
I ended up redesigning the backend multiple times as it became hard to understand 
and read when more things were added. If I planned how the code would work and 
stuck to some proper design patterns this could have been avoided.

### Javascript
As I don't have much JavaScript experience this was a bit challenging.
I think the main problem I have with JavaScript is that I didn't stick to 
any guidelines or anything. It also doesn't help that everyone on the internet 
disagrees with each other on the best way to use JavaScript, e.g. if ES5 classes 
should be used.

I think for next time I'm going to try and stick to some syntax / a specific 
way to do things. TypeScript might be what I'm looking for as it forces you to 
use javascript in a specific way.

### Frontend
I think the frontend is ok, but it definitely needs some work. I think the 
main problem was that I did it from scratch. This meant the majority 
of my time was spent on the frontend (although this may be because I'm more experienced 
with backend). If I chose some framework or even some templates this could have 
been done quicker, and it would also look nicer.

## Updating
The following are just some things I implemented that stood out as interesting.
### Remember me functionality
I found [this blog page](https://paragonie.com/blog/2015/04/secure-authentication-php-with-long-term-persistence) 
about implementing remember me functionality within php. 
It gave me a good idea about how to implement the functionality, 
but it also helped make me aware of some potential security issues 
I hadn't thought of before. 

An example was timing attacks. In the example it describes how searching 
up credentials in a database may indicate how correct the guess is. Say 
for example you needed to lookup if a given string exists. A closer match 
would take longer to reject as it checks more characters before finding out 
the value is incorrect, whereas, if the first character is wrong it would return 
false almost instantly.

### Monthly Payments
Not too long after using the website I realised that some things would become 
tedious when logging manually. One of these would be payments that occur on a 
monthly basis like bills etc. So to solve this I added a new entity that could 
be used to produce transactions on a monthly basis. This entity contains pretty 
much the same information as a transaction only it also contains the date at which
it should be added. I made a daily cron job that would pick up these monthly 
transactions and create normal transactions from them if the payment day was 
the current day.

I also added an option, so you could manually create a transaction from 
these monthly transactions. The date of the monthly transaction could also 
be removed meaning it would never be automatically added as a transaction. 
This was pretty useful if you had a frequent payment that had inconsistent 
timing as you only need to press one button instead of filling out all the 
transaction's information. 

## Examples
The site is currently pretty empty and has a lot of blank space. The following 
screenshots show some examples of the different pages / functionalities, and a brief 
explanation if needed.
### Sign up / Login screen
This is just a simple form with two fields. I didn't add any css as the remember me
functionality would skip this step most of the time.

### Adding entities
All the entities you could add (transactions, categories etc.) had very similar pages.
They consisted of fields you could fill out and then just a button to submit the data.

### Viewing entities
When viewing the entities you've added most of the pages were pretty similar. They
would consist of a list and then a total of the list if they had a monetary value.

### Filtering entities
As it would be inefficient to retrieve all of certain entities at once, some of them
were filtered. Transactions were retrieved by a date range, you could then filter them
by account or category.

Other entities were filtered to stop displaying less important data so often. For example
the accounts that were closed were viewed on a different tab.

### Editing and Deleting entities
To remove or update entities they would have an edit button that appeared. This would 
cause a popup with all the values of the entity populated. You could then
change the desired fields and update, or just delete the entity.

### Categories tree (WIP)
This was a work in progress, but the idea was to show how much of the spending was in
each category. You would be able to view a tree that would nicely show you the sums
how your spending was split between categories. Although currently it's not very pretty
and a bit confusing.

### Home page
The goal of the home page was to give a quick summary over certain fixed time periods. 
You could select your time period (month, year, week) and the spending per account 
would be shown, as well as the predicted spending if you continued to spend at the same
rate.

### Mobile
The app looks slightly different on mobile, which is where I use it the most. The nav
bar is hidden by a burger menu button. I prefer the look of the website this way as it
fills up more available space.

## Summary
In summary, I'm pretty happy with the website. It achieves the goal it set out to do, 
which is to log personal spending.

There are a couple of things I would like to change though. One of which is the design
and layout of the website. Most of the css was done without using any of the newer
features like flexbox and grids, which made it a lot harder to do.

The other thing is the fact that the backend is only designed to handle forms submitted
from the frontend. If I wanted to use the backend for a different frontend, or potentially
an app, it would be hard to do and the submitted data would need to be awkwardly mutated.
It would be much better if the backend fit to some specifications, such as a REST API.

I would make sure to think about these and the other problems I faced when designing the
new version of the website. You can read about that [here](design.html).
